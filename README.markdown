# AdBlock Pure

AdBlock Pure is a new ad blocking extension for Google Chrome and Chromium.

AdBlock Pure is a fork of the last version of AdBlock which did not participate in the "acceptable ads" program. This means that AdBlock Pure blocks all ads, unlike AdBlock and Adblock Plus.

AdBlock Pure is almost identical in functionality to AdBlock 2.40.1. The AdBlock Pure project is dedicated to more complete ad blocking and better privacy practices. AdBlock Pure permanently removes "acceptable ads" and data collection. An additional ad blocking filter (Fanboy's Ultimate) has been added as an optional setting (disabled by default). See CHANGELOG.md for more information.

## Installation

AdBlock Pure is available in the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-pure/nljjbcdkobohpmklgnhjalfebmmdajca

If you would rather not use the Chrome Web Store, you may install it manually:

1. Download the zip here
2. Extract it to a directory
3. Open Chrome's extensions page: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Load the directory into that page (either via drag and drop or by clicking the button).
