# AdBlock Pure

AdBlock Pure is a new ad blocking extension for Google Chrome and Chromium.

AdBlock Pure is a fork of the last version of AdBlock that didn't permit unacceptable ads to be displayed. This means that AdBlock Pure blocks ALL ads, unlike AdBlock and Adblock Plus. A few modifications were made to improve the privacy practices (no data collection, no links to their website), and rename the extension. Otherwise it remains virtually identical. See CHANGELOG.txt for more details.

AdBlock Pure is free and open source software, licensed under GPLv3 because it is a fork of the original AdBlock which is also licensed under GPLv3. The source code that AdBlock Pure was derived from is available at AdBlock's website: http://code.getadblock.com/releases/AdBlock-v2.40.1.zip

AdBlock Pure is not available in the Chrome Web Store because Google claims that it violates a section of their policy which it clearly does not violate. If you would like to install AdBlock Pure, you must download the zip here, extract it to a directory, and load that directory into Chrome's extensions page (either via drag and drop or by clicking the button).
